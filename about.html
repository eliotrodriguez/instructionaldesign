                Greetings! I am Eliot, a Southern California native with a diverse range of experiences and a passion for continuous learning. I embarked on my academic journey at UC Santa Cruz, where I pursued a dual degree in Politics and Mathematics. Little did I know that my path would lead me to a fulfilling career in special education.

            <p>
                For several years, I dedicated myself to teaching special education, finding profound joy in making a positive impact on the lives of my students. Beyond the classroom, my interests extend to the exploration of different cultures and cuisines. My love for travel has allowed me to broaden my perspectives and immerse myself in the beauty of diversity.

                In addition to my commitment to education, I am currently expanding my linguistic horizons by delving into conversational Spanish. This endeavor reflects my belief in the power of effective communication and understanding across cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I have honed my skills in utilizing tools such as Articulate Storyline, Adobe Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. These tools have been instrumental in bringing to life my flagship projects, showcasing a blend of creativity and technical proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the professional realm, I find solace and enjoyment in various activities. Whether it's engaging in strategic games, delving into a captivating book, or simply going for walks and hikes, I cherish moments of leisure that contribute to a well-rounded and balanced life.
