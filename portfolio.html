<!-- My Problem Section -->
    <div class="container-problem">
        <div>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Fantasia School District, a conceptual entity, has identified a concerning trend: an increase in maladaptive behaviors among students on the Autism spectrum. This issue has led to dissatisfaction among educators, paraprofessionals, administrators, and parents alike, with some parents even considering legal action against the district.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the onset of the 2023-24 school year, the district took proactive steps to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive two-hour training session. This training aimed to equip educators with the understanding of token boards' purpose and how to utilize them effectively. However, despite a commendable 95% passing rate on the post-training quiz, the district has observed minimal to no improvement in the implementation of token boards over the past three months.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following a meticulous analysis of this performance issue and extensive consultations with subject matter experts, behavior specialists, educators, classified staff, and administrators, it became evident that many professionals lacked the requisite skills and knowledge to deploy token boards effectively.

<!-- The Solution -->
    <div class="container-solution">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Following input from subject matter experts, we crafted an immersive eLearning module using scenario-based learning. This approach provides educators with a risk-free environment to hone their skills in implementing token board strategies, simulating real-world classroom scenarios. By experiencing and reflecting on the consequences within the module, educators are better prepared to effectively deploy token boards in their classrooms, enhancing student engagement and classroom management.

<!-- Div Process & MindMeister -->
    <div class="container-process">
        <div>
            <h2>My Process</h2>
            <p>
                During the Analysis phase, I conducted meetings with subject matter experts, behavior specialists, and a diverse range of professionals, including teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators, to gather comprehensive insights into token boards. This phase culminated in the creation of an action map, laying the groundwork for the subsequent development of a text-based storyboard. Throughout this process, I maintained ongoing consultations with subject matter experts to ensure alignment with best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon approval of the storyboard by stakeholders, I transitioned to the Design phase, where I meticulously crafted visual designs, initially focusing on low-fidelity mockups before refining them into high-fidelity representations. Subsequently, in the Development phase, I translated these designs into a functional prototype, showcasing the interactive elements of the eLearning platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the completion of the development process, the eLearning scenario-based activity underwent thorough evaluation by peers and professionals. Their feedback was instrumental in refining and optimizing the project to ensure its effectiveness and functionality in meeting the identified educational objectives.
            </p>
            <h2>Action Map</h2>

                <img src="media\mindmeister.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>
                Collaborating with teachers and behavior therapists across diverse school settings, I engaged in a comprehensive Action Mapping process to outline common pitfalls encountered by educators. Through this collaborative effort, we meticulously identified areas for improvement and formulated a targeted learning objective for our eLearning initiative: equipping teachers and educators with the necessary skills to effectively implement token board strategies, resulting in a 25% reduction in maladaptive behaviors among students on the Autism spectrum. This structured approach ensured alignment between instructional goals and learner needs, optimizing the effectiveness of the eLearning intervention.

<!-- Text-based Storyboard -->
    <div class="container-text">
        <div>
            <h2>Text-based Storyboard </h2>
            <p>
                After the completion of Action Mapping in consultation with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), the next phase involved crafting the eLearning narrative through text-based storyboards. These storyboards underwent multiple iterations, incorporating invaluable feedback from seasoned SMEs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The storyline was meticulously designed to immerse learners in a realistic scenario, placing them in the role of a teacher struggling to address maladaptive behaviors in a student. The narrative unfolds as the teacher seeks guidance from a behavior therapist regarding the token board system. Each aspect of the scenario was carefully vetted in collaboration with SMEs to ensure authenticity and relevance.
            </p>
            <div class="image-media-container">

                <img src="media\scenario-qc.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                Throughout the design process, emphasis was placed on creating an interactive experience where learners face consequences for their choices. Incorrect selections prompt learners to revisit the scenario, reinforcing the importance of decision-making and learning through trial and error.
            </p>

<!-- Visual Mockups -->

                Visual Mockups
            </h2>
            <p>
                Following the refinement and approval of the text-based storyboard, the project transitioned into the creation of visual mockups to bring the scenario to life. Leveraging Figma, I meticulously crafted wireframes and low-fidelity mockups to establish the structural framework for each slide type, including titles, questions, consequences, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                This initial phase provided a solid foundation, allowing for a clear understanding of the layout and flow of the scenario. With the wireframes in place, I seamlessly progressed to developing high-fidelity mockups, transforming the conceptual framework into a tangible representation of the eLearning experience.
            </p>
            <p>    
                The visual mockup phase was an exhilarating journey as the scenario began to take shape, offering a glimpse into the immersive learning environment that learners would soon engage with. Integrating the narrative into the visual design further enriched the user experience, ensuring alignment with the overarching instructional goals.

    <!-- Interactive Prototype -->
    <div class="container-interactive">
        <div>
            <h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing Articulate Storyline 360, I developed the interactive prototype following the completion of visual mockups and storyboarding, which served as the blueprint for the scenario's progression. The prototype encompasses essential components such as the title screen, learning objectives, scenario introduction, and consequences for both correct and incorrect responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interactive prototyping phase was particularly thrilling as I witnessed the narrative come to life through dynamic animations created using Vyond. Carefully orchestrating each scene, I customized character movements and expressions to seamlessly align with the storyline. Ensuring precise timing, I integrated multiple Vyond scenes into a single slide within Storyline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within Storyline, meticulous attention was paid to the design and positioning of text and dialogue boxes, enhancing the user experience. I also incorporated hover states for buttons and employed fade transitions to smoothly transition between scenes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon completion, the prototype was shared for feedback, focusing on the overall look, feel, and user experience of the scenario. The feedback received has been positive, with minor adjustments planned to refine pause timelines. Once satisfied, I will proceed to full development, confident in the effectiveness of the interactive prototype.
